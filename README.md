# Active Learning Experiment Framework
A simple framework on which more complex experiments involving active learning with deep neural netowkrs can be based upon.

Implementation inspired by [Deep Active Learning](https://github.com/ej0cl6/deep-active-learning) from [Kuan-Hao Huang](http://khhuang.net/).
